# Game-of-Mines
"Mine Game of Stake" is a gambling game where players first place a bet and then select the number of mines to place in a grid. The higher the number of mines, the greater the risk and potential reward. Players pick a box on the grid; if it contains a diamond, they win and earn a profit on their bet. If it contains a bomb, they lose their bet amount. The game's risk-reward balance depends on the number of mines chosen.
